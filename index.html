		<p>I graduated from the Savannah College of Art and Design in 2016 with a B.F.A. in Illustration. Painting digitally is one of my passions.I paint a whole lot for myself and for others on the side. I am slowly, yet surely working on starting my own side freelance art business. I got into coding while working as a sales/marketing intern for a developer, and then I started teaching myself HTML and CSS before enrolling in the UNC coding Bootcamp to learn more. I hope to keep learning and bettering myself in web development so as I can eventually take my knowledge to make creative ideas come to life.</p>

		<p id="second-paragraph">Outside of learning coding and painting I love to run, hang out with friends, laugh often, drink coffee, and find new music to listen to.</p>
